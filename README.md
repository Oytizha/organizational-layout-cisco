# Organizational Layout Project
Welcome to the Organizational Layout Project! This project is designed, with [@Fa](https://github.com/Fari-ha), to provide a comprehensive network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer. The layout includes 6 routers, 4 switches, 3 servers, 1 cloud node, and a variety of devices interconnected through the RIP (Routing Information Protocol) protocol.

# Project Structure
The network is organized into distinct segments, each serving specific functions within the organization. Here's an overview of the main components:
- Routers (6): These devices facilitate communication between different network segments and manage the flow of data.
- Switches (4): Connecting multiple devices within a local network, switches efficiently manage data traffic at the link layer.
- Servers (3): Centralized resources for data storage, processing, or application hosting.
- Cloud Node (1): Represents external networks or the internet, providing a gateway to the wider digital landscape.
- Devices: A variety of devices, such as computers, printers, or IoT devices, are strategically placed to simulate a real-world organizational network.

# Routing Protocol
The project employs the RIP (Routing Information Protocol) for dynamic routing. RIP is utilized to exchange routing information between routers, ensuring efficient and adaptive routing within the network.

# Usage
To simulate and explore the network layout:
- Cisco Packet Tracer: Open the project file in Cisco Packet Tracer to visualize and interact with the network components.
- Configuration: Explore the configurations of routers, switches, and servers to understand the network setup.
- Simulation: Use the simulation mode to observe how data flows through the network, and test different scenarios.
